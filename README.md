## Pick Em League Rules and Description
### Overview
Pick Em League is an alternative (better alternative) to fantasy football. No need to research specific players or watch any waiver wires, just look at the team match ups, maybe consult some vegas odds, and pick the winner. You will rank each game according to how confident you are in that winner, the more confident you are the higher value you give that match up. Picking the correct winner will earn you those points, picking wrong gets you nothing. Get the highest point total for the week and you will earn a prize. Be at the top of the leader board at the end of the season and earn a much bigger prize. More detailed rules below.

### Making Picks
Each week you will pick the game winners and order them based on how confident you are in that result. If there are 16 games that week then you will have ranks from 1-16, 16 being your most confident pick, 1 being your least. For example, any team that is playing the Jaguars (or Bears) is basically guaranteed a win so put 16 on them. If two teams appear equally matched and you think it is a toss up, then you will put them lower in your rankings, such as a 1. Picking correct will earn you that rank value and add to your weekly and season total. Games that result in a tie count as an incorrect pick and will award no points.

### Entry Fee
The price to participate is $5 per week to be paid at the beginning of the season, $85. Must be paid before the season starts.

### Payouts
There will be a few different ways to earn your entry fee back. First if you are the winner of a specific week then you will earn half of that weeks entry fees. It may be about half, depending on the size of the league some small amount may be reserved for infrastructure costs (site maintenance and hosting) and (more interestingly) side bets/wins. The more players, the more room for extra payouts and winning opportunities. For example if there were 10 players in the league then that weeks total purse would be $50 (10 * $5) meaning the winner would earn ~$25. The other $25 will go to the season purse. At the end of the season the top 3 players will earn payouts. Exact payout amounts will depend on the number of players in the league and season payouts are subject to slight changes (I will reveal those amounts as soon as I know them). They will roughly be:
- 1st: 50%
- 2nd: 35%
- 3rd: Money back ($85)
